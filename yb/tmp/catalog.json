I&#039;ll say it one more time, I don&#039;t like how this new girl basically walked in and got in between Nonoka and Noei&#039;s personal friendship. Basically and I know this isn&#039;t a rule obviously but if you&#039;re going to be close friends with Noei then you&#039;re going to be close friends with Nonoka too! <br><br>I know that might sound weird but I got a couple friends like this in real life, we&#039;re all very close and no &#039;not in that way&#039;. I&#039;m basically saying one does not get left out and this OVA did a horrible job building a type of friendship circle between these three characters.
