DHULIKHEL, NEPAL

using standard journal entry;

    implemented simple GraphModule and NetModule for
ChanBrowser( download boards.json, simple JSplitPanel ).
    
    will most likely only be able to work on this sporadically, owing
to drone project with Bipin and the rest.
    
    will add a new entry for each non-trivial update, the definition of 'trivial'
being scaled down to match the relatively small scope of the project
