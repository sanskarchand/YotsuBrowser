DHULIKHEL, NEPAL

using standard journal entry;

    implemented simple GraphModule and NetModule for
ChanBrowser( download boards.json, simple JSplitPanel ).
    
    will most likely only be able to work on this sporadically, owing
to drone project with Bipin and the rest.
    
    will add a new entry for each non-trivial update, the definition of 'trivial'
being scaled down to match the relatively small scope of the project

    using Racota to track time


    can now see the thumbnails and subjects of the posts  on page no. 1 of any board 
        ( will thumbnailing work with .webms? not sure )

    Forgot to use Racota. Oh well.


    No new features added, but successfully removed the need to print to console
        unnecessarily.

    Instead of an M-V-C pattern, ended up with an MV-C one. Need to brush up on GoF.
    
    Ready to implement page changing
