1) find out why the mainLoop() function requires a System print call
   If I forego that, the EDT seems to consume everything ( "optimized away"? )

2) implement policies to follow the terms of service of the API

Been a long time
To do:
Features:
    -> filter 4chan's HTML to a form usable by Swing
    -> actually add the ability to view thread contents;
    -> 'pic related's could be opened in a new window,
            in order to keep the text consistent

Bugfix:
    -> thread posts are not being displayed in JLabels.
